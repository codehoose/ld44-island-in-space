You are an island in space. You have resources. The resources are you!
# Ideas
## Resources
* Water
	- Drinking
	- Powering machines (steam)
* Minerals
	- Decorations
	- Lifeform currency
* Wood
	- Building houses - shelter for them
	- Fuel - warmth, better society? Because of industrialization???

## Other Lifeforms
Cause you pain by consuming (using) your resources. Remember-- you ARE the resources.

The more lifeforms there are the more resources (you) that is used
You can stop the lifeforms from using resources by punishing(?) them
	- Flood
	- Cave in the mine
	- Natural disaster

Lifeforms can give back by...?
	- Worshiping you?
	- Planting trees?

## Meters
	- Resource levels for each separate item; water, wood, minerals
	- Worship level increases water, wood, minerals over time
		- Starts off neutral to you
		- If you are nice to them (you use your resource) they will worship you
		  This is where the idea of life as currency comes in. As you let your 
		  'body' be used, you exchange it for worship
	- The number of lifeforms on the island in space
	- The number of generations of lifeforms (just a number)

## Mechanics
They want to use some resource
You counter by allowing the use of the resource or punishing them.
For example:
	- A cave in reduces their ability to mine by X%
	- Poison the water
	- Tell them to stop cutting down the trees

# Turns

* Lifeforms deal their three cards
* Planet is dealt their three/ two? cards

Player decides how to action the cards. They can only choose two cards to play at a time. After each round, the remaining card is disposed of.
